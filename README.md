This project was assigned to me to build a basic To-Do List application using C++. The goal was to create a console-based program that allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively.

ðŸ”§ Features Implemented:
Add new tasks with a title and category (like Work, Personal, etc.)

View all tasks or filter by category

Mark tasks as completed (instead of removing them)

Remove tasks from the list if needed

Display completed tasks separately

Save tasks to a file (tasks.txt) and load them again on the next run

ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes:
File handling with fstream

Dynamic data storage using vector

Creating user-friendly menus and options

Basic use of struct for task management

Simple filtering logic for organizing tasks

This project helped me practice working with file input/output, struct-based data, and vectors â€” all important building blocks in C++ programming.
